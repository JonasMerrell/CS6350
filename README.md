# This is a machine learning library developed by Jonas Merrell for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

HW2.sh just runs the codes. This should work from within the directory that it is located in.
use the HW2_example_run.py file to run my code. The basic setup for each ML algorithm is done there. 

HW2/HW2.py has all the code I used to create my plots for the assignment. You will no be able to run this as it read all my pickle files I generated. Over 6GB of data so I won't be pushing those.
